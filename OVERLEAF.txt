Abstract:
    - Linear Stability
        - Crude (ie discrete)
        - Mathematical Version
    - Experiments
        - Autonomous Vehicles
            - Traffic Flow ^^
            - Safety ^^
        - Traffic Lights
            - Orange lights
        - Variable speed limits
    
Limitations:
    - Humans CAN see over another vehicle to the traffic Lights
    - Governing equation backwards bull
    - Parameters (velocity delta issues)
